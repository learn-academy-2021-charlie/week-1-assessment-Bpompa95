# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: So far from what i know a function are little machines that run when we decide and how often we decide. we need function cause when we create a function we can also, call it.
  For example,
  function fun() {
    console.log('this is a function');
  }

  call is fun();

  Researched answer:a javascript function is a block of code designed to perform task. A function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).



2. In regards to functions, what is the difference between an argument and a parameter?

  Your answer: The difference between a parameter and argument, the parameter is a placeholder/variable that is specific to the function and argument, is passing actual data that javascript recognizes into the the function.

  Researched answer:An argument is the instance passed to the method during runtime. the parameter refers to any declaration within the parentheses following the method/function name.



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer:From what i remember an index help us access a string. The difference between index and value, The value can be something that has to be calculated or something that will be provided later, For example the types of values are; Numbers, Strings, Booleans, Objects, Undefined values, etc. Index ALWAYS starts with a Zero For example;
  var names =['iron man, loki, spider man, hulk']
  index:         0         1      2          3

  Researched answer:An index means that each collection's or array's items is indexed. Index is a reference to the actual place holder in the elements value of an array. value used to define what the actual variable type value is being held in the elements/ indexes.



4. What is a built-in method?

  Your answer:A built- in method gathers the languages for a a stronger action and uses a lot of different categories for example; toLowerCase, toUppercase, join, reverse, slice and etc.

  Researched answer:Any function that is provided as part of a high-level language and can be executed by a simple reference with specification of arguments.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer:when you do pair programming, 1 person drives meaning he/she is the one typing the information while the navigator gives the driver the information on what type of method he/she has to put. You have to switch back and forth for every 10mins so both partners can give their own logic and type.

  Researched answer: allows students to explore realistic situation by interacting with other people in managed way in order to develop experience and trial different strategies in a supported environment.



6. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: yes what really help me a lot is the reverse method for question number 3. and question was really really difficult i couldn't get the right answer for it until sarah gave a hint which was if/else and that gave a light bulb so i used if/else and type of.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Iteration:means repeating steps, or instructions, over and over again until condition is met.

2. Higher Order Functions:Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them.

3. Jest:Jest is a JavaScript test runner, that is, a JavaScript library for creating, running, and structuring tests. Jest ships as an NPM package, you can install it in any JavaScript project. Jest is one of the most popular test runner these days, and the default choice for React projects

4. Classes: a class is a template definition of the method s and variable s in a particular kind of object . Thus, an object is a specific instance of a class; it contains real values instead of variables. The class is one of the defining ideas of object-oriented programming.

5. React:React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.
